# AES Demo App

This is a demo application showcasing AES encryption and decryption functionality using the BouncyCastle cryptography library and JSON serialization/deserialization using the Newtonsoft.Json library.

## AES Encryption and Decryption

The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption algorithm in various modes of operation (e.g., CBC, CTR) with different key sizes. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting files, choosing encryption parameters, and performing encryption and decryption operations.

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/LazyNora/AESDemo/releases) section of this repository.
2. Find the latest release and locate the downloadable executable file (EXE).
3. Download the EXE file by clicking on it.
4. Once downloaded, double-click the EXE file to run the application.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the application.
